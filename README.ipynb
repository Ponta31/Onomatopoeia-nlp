    "# Japanese Onomatopoeia Paraphraser Model\n",
    "\n",
    "_This project applies Word2Vec model to paraphrase a word in a Japanese sentence to a similar onomatopoeia. The purpose of this model is to help students in Japanese class learn Japanese onomatopoeia, since the Japanese language is very rich with onomatopoeia._\n",

    "## Key Feature\n",
    "- POS tagging\n",
    "- Word2Vec model trained on a corpus and onomatopoeia sentences\n",
    "- semantic similarity matching between regular words and onomatopoeia\n",

    "## Paraphrasing Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "The model follows specific syntactic patterns to identify which words to replace:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the sentence contains adverb + adjective + verb in sequence, it paraphrases the adjective\n",
    "2. If the sentence contains adverb + verb in sequence, it paraphrases the verb\n",
    "3. If the sentence contains an adjective without a verb, it paraphrases the adjective\n",
    "4. If only a verb is contained without adjectives or adverbs, it inserts an onomatopoeia in front of the verb\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Result Analysis\n",
    "The model generated the following outputs. When the target word was either an adverb or an adjective, the model replaced it with an onomatopoeia. For verbs, the model inserted an onomatopoeia immediately before the verb.\n",
    "As a native Japanese speaker, I evaluated each suggested onomatopoeia for semantic appropriateness. In patterns 1 and 2 (involving adverbs and adjectives), I marked with an \"S\" those onomatopoeia that were somewhat semantically similar to the target word's meaning within a context. For pattern 3 (involving verbs), I marked with an \"S\" those cases where the onomatopoeia appropriately matched the verb. Cases that were semantically inappropriate were marked with an \"X\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The accuracy rates for each pattern were:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Result1(Adverbs)**:8/30(26%)\n",
    "- **Result2(Adjectives)**: 7/30(23%)\n",
    "- **Result3(Verbs)**: 5/35(14%)\n",
    "\n",
    "These results indicate that while the model shows some ability to match onomatopoeia with appropriate words, there is significant room for improvement in semantic alignment. The relatively low accuracy rates highlight the challenges in computational modeling of Japanese onomatopoeia, which often have subtle contextual and emotional connotations that are difficult to capture with the current approach.\n",

    "## Limitations and Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limited onomatopoeia sentences**: The current dataset contains fewer than 100 onomatopoeia sentences, which is not sufficient for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Word2Vec limitaions**: Due to the limited dataset of onomatopoeia sentences, the model may not capture proper meanings of onomatopoeia expressions. Also, Word2Vec can only consider words within a defined window, and doesn't account for broader context.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recognition of conjugated words**: The model doesn't recognize different conjugation forms, such as '歩く'(dictionary form) and '歩いている'(present progressive form).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recognition of different styles of Japanese**: Japanese writing has three styles (Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji), and the model recognizes those separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "___Future improvements___:\n",
    "- Use Web scraping technique to collect more examples of onomatopoeia sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement RNN or LSTM to improve contextual understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Modify the model to recognize conjugated words and Japanese different writing styles through lemmatization or morphological analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the challenges in capturing the nuanced meanings of Japanese onomatopoeia, the current model did not perform as well as intended. However, with the future improvements above, this tool could become a valuable resource for students striving to master Japanese expressions. By employing both NLP and language pedagogy, this project has demonstrated the potential of an innovative approach to Japanese language learning. \n",
